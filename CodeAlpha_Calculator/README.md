## 💡 How It Works

- Uses `speechSynthesis` from the **Web Speech API** to speak words.  
- Detects Alexa or English voices if available, ensuring natural tone and pronunciation.  
- Every time a key is pressed, it triggers `speakTyping()` for live voice feedback.  
- When a calculation is made, it triggers `speakIt()` to announce the final result.
